# Vignettes Distribution System

Program simulating selling vignettes by a gas station. Each driver can
buy a single vignette for a single vehicle he owns, or he can buy vignettes
for all vehicles he owns. Vignettes are sold by a gas station, the gas station
generates an amount of vignettes at the begining of the program (10000 vignettes)
and shows the available vignettes for sale. A driver can buy a vignette only through
a gas station he is signed for.
